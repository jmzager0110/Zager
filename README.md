I'm Jessica Zager. After years as an end-user, I decided to get into the developer world. 
I fell in :revolving_hearts: with CSS way back in 2001... Started learning HTML5 in 2010...
I graduated from [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org) in December 2021 & landed my first job in January 2022!

Now I am a full stack developer, working in AQ for a website I used to use daily in an entirely different field!

[Hit me up on LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/jmzager0110)

I am in the Kansas City Metropolitan area, but I was raised outside Houston, TX.



Now I love learning every new (to me) framework, language, whatever out there.
My repos consist of TypeScript, Angular, and loads of Java with a healthy smattering of SpringBoot. <br>

Still learning BootStrap, Sass, php, Drupal... The list probably won't stop. :dizzy_face:

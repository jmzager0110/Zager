I'm Jessica Zager. After years as an end-user, I decided to get into the developer world. 
I fell in :revolving_hearts: with CSS way back in 2001... Started learning HTML5 in 2010...
I graduated from [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org) in December 2021 & landed my first job in January 2022!
Check out their [blog](https://blog.launchcode.org/sharing-gratitude-and-joy-21-things-we-accomplished-in-2021), they actually quoted me!
From LaunchCode, I learned:
- Java
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Angular
- Node
- Sprng
- mySQL
- Jasmine

I graduated as a full stack developer, I got my first job as an apprentice in Automation of Quality at [VMLY&R](https://www.vmlyr.com/).
The first project I was assigned was a website I used daily in an entirely different field! <br>

Currently, I am a Technology Specialist at VML in the Automation of Quality practice. I can honestly say I've thrived in this environment.
To date, I've learned:
- BakstopJS
- Jenkins (plus Administration)
- Selenium
- PostMan
- WebLink Validator
- Total Validator
- Analytics Debugging
- Storybook
- Drupal
- Accessibility Testing
- JMeter
- DebugBear
- Figma

I reside in the Kansas City Metropolitan area, but I was raised outside Houston, TX. 

I love learning every new (to me) framework, language, whatever out there.
My repos consist of TypeScript, Angular, and loads of Java with a healthy smattering of SpringBoot. <br>
One of my main goals is to organize all repos and include good README's to each, hopefully that will be done soon! <br>
